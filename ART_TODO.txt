This is my (szopen's) personal list of what I'd love to have. If you 
are an artist and want to contribute, please look at this list and think whether
you could do these portraits. You can also hire someone to do them, or 
send me 20-40 euros and I will pay my artist to do them. In general,
I pay between 13 to 20 euros per portrait (though "another Karen" probably would
need to be twice as much, as it would most likely have to be ordered from
Santiago Iborra), and between 20 to 40 euros per story image (assuming
euro ~~ 4PLN, since I pay in PLN). Paypal charges about 5%. Note that since this
is an old campaign, some of these euro/PLN amounts may need to be adjusted for
inflation. In times when this campaign has an American maintainer (e.g. egallager),
payments may need to be in USD instead. The inflation calculator I found gives the
following amounts for 2022, assuming that the original amounts were from 2005, when
this campaign was first written:
* €13 in 2005 = €17.10 in 2022 (~$17.84 USD)
* €20 in 2005 = €26.31 in 2022 (~$27.44 USD)
* €40 in 2005 = €52.61 in 2022 (~$54.88 USD)
(Note that some artists have informed that these prices are rather low compared to
their rates, so negotiation is welcome... unless you don't actually think they're
low, in which case we can just stick with whichever of them are closest to your
usual rates)

If you are an artist who is new to Wesnoth, here are some links to resources that
you may find helpful for matching Wesnoth style:
* "Create art" central navigation page: https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Create_Art
* "How to Shade": https://wiki.wesnoth.org/How_to_Shade
* "Portrait Tutorial": https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Portrait_Tutorial
* "Armor Tutorial": https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Armour_Tutorial
* "Technical requirements for portraits": https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?t=24555
Also, if you are basing your portraits off of the sprites (which you really ought
to), you should probably also see the articles on Team Coloring to know what to do
with the magenta parts on the sprites:
* "TeamColoring": https://wiki.wesnoth.org/TeamColoring
* "Team Color Shifting": https://wiki.wesnoth.org/Team_Color_Shifting

The following wishlist items are sorted in order of importance.  In addition, you
may consider making animations for sprites, or correct existing sprites.

PORTRAITS
---------
* Generic "good" Akladian high level unit, specifically the Darknite (one that
  matches its sprite better)
* A better "Broken" Ruvio, after Fall of Freetown (current one is by a different
  artist from the one for "regular" Ruvio, who left out a lot of his wrinkles)
* Generic low-level Akladian unit with swords (Raiders+Sturmknight) 
* Generic Akladian unit with spears (Warrior and LightInfantry still remain)
  (Clansman already exists as akladian_generic.png and Pikeneer already exists as
  profile_pikinier.png)
* A winter version of Yahyazad's portrait
* Another Reme portrait (for the "m"-suffixed message macro for him)
* Generic leading units (Chieftain+leader - this is very low priority)
* A winter version of Karen's portrait (low priority, and it'd be more expensive)
  (there's one in the ANO_art repo, but it doesn't match her usual look, so one of
  the two would have to be updated)
* Heinric the Redbeard (enemy leader from the first scenario; can be either a City
  Militia or a Lieutenant, depending on difficulty) (low priority)
* better older-looking mage for the medic who heals Gawen in S01 (low priority)
  (current one is a lazy frankenportrait that I just threw together myself)
* portraits for some of the less-important units with descriptive names, e.g.
  "John the Baldhead" (a peasant discoverable in S13), "Fat Bart" (an enemy
  Fugitive leader attacking the Oracle in S19c), and "Robert the Hefty" (an enemy
  Fugitive leader in S27, Orannon) (low priority)
* unique portrait for Rob Roe (an Outlaw), to replace the generic Thug portrait
  that doesn't even match his unit type
* unique portrait for Maurice (a Red Mage), to replace the generic White Mage
  portrait that doesn't even match his unit type
* A shadowy version of Grekulak's portrait, to foreshadow his appearance, without
  spoiling him before he's revealed (e.g. in Deorien's story) (it might actually
  be possible to just do this with IPFs; I'll have to check...)
  (update: the ~BW(255) IPF works for making his portrait shadowy, the tricky part
  is then just finding the right coordinates to blit it onto on the relevant story
  images...)

STORY IMAGES
------------
* Blinded Lorin telling her final story (see stare/lorin/lorin_opowiada.xcf and
  stare/story_images/lorin/lorin_opowiada.png in the ANO_art repo for reference;
  it was removed from the actual campaign due to quality, though)
* "Lorin became more taciturn" after talk with Oracle (sitting outside camp and
  gazing into the sky)
* Akladians invading Wesnoth -- plundering, wondering what spoons are for, and
  trying to hear the stories imprisoned within books (for prologue) (see
  stare/story/story_fire_bg.xcf and stare/story_images/story/story_fire.png in the
  ANO_art repo for a reference; it was removed from the actual campaign due to
  quality, though)
* An image illustrating how Grekulak escaped through the swamps (for Deorien's
  story: a dark silhouette on dark background)
* An image illustrating a rebellion of Akladians against Grekulak (Deorien's story)
* An image illustrating the Akladians' escape across the deserts (Deorien's story)
* An image illustrating Grekulak's failed "twisted experiments" (Deorien's story)
* An image illustrating the siege of Weldyn (Akladians storming walls)
* An image illustrating how the Akladians treat the traitor, who opened the
  gates of Weldyn (see S21d, "Ruins of Weldyn", for reference)
* Akladians overpowering Lorin (in scenario after Orannon) (see
  stare/lorin/lorin_lezy.xcf and stare/story_images/story/story_powerless.png in
  the ANO_art repo for reference; it was removed from the actual campaign due to
  quality, though)
* Mother of Gawen and Akladians intriguing behind her back (for prologue)
* Lorin next to poisoned Gawen (for prologue)
* Lorin vs Karen finally getting along (from Gawen's point of view) (except
  they're not actually getting along, though, Gawen is just clueless about their
  true relations. See how in the ANO_art repo, stare/story/story_lorin_karen.xcf
  and stare/story_images/story/story_lorin_karen.png still have the two of them
  disagreeing; this is supposed to have a humorous effect)
* images for the epilogue (Ruvio's burial, Lorin riding to the Dunefolk
  sietches with her son)
* Lorin riding into a Dunefolk sietch
* furious Bor Cryne wishing for the finding of Gawen's body (see
  stare/story/furious*.xcf and stare/story_images/story/story_furious.png in the
  ANO_art repo for references; they were removed from the actual campaign due to
  quality, though)
* see also images_TODO.txt in the ANO_art repo (might be slightly outdated, but it
  might also have some things missing from here; I haven't fully compared the lists
  yet...) https://github.com/cooljeanius/ANO_art/blob/main/images_TODO.txt
