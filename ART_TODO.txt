This is my personal list of what I'd love to have. If you 
are an artist and want to contribute, please look at this list and think whether
you could do these portraits. You can also hire someone to do them, or 
sent me 20-40 euros and I will pay my artist to do them. In general,
I pay between 13 to 20 euros per portrait (though "broken Ruvio" and "another
Karen" probably would need twice as much, as they would have to be ordered
from Santiago Iborra), and between 20 to 40 euros per story image (assuming
euro ~~ 4PLN, since I pay in PLN). Paypal charges about 5%.

They are sorted in order of importance.  In addition, you may consider making
animations for sprites, or correct existing sprites.

PORTRAITS
---------
* Hagarthen kings: Luc, Buffin, Gauri (one generic king is enough, but two or three
  would be nice too - once I have one portrait, two more are low priority)
* Generic "good" Akladian high level unit (e.g. Protector, Shieldguard, maybe 
  also Fastfoot)
* "Broken" Ruvio, after fall of Freetown (preferrably bought from Santiago Iborra,
  if we can find the funds, which seems unlikely...)
* Generic low-level Akladian unit with swords (Raiders+Homeguard) 
* Generic Akladian unit with spears (Pikeneer, Warrior, Clansman, LightInfantry)
* Generic leading units (Chieftain+leader - this is very low priority)
* Another version of Karen picture (low priority, and it would be more expensive)
* Dunefolk (Boris) (low priority)
* Heinric the Redbeard (from the first scenario) (low priority)
* older-looking mage for the medic who heals Gawen (low priority)

STORY IMAGES
------------
* Blinded Lorin telling her final story
* "Lorin became more taciturn" after talk with Oracle (sitting outside camp and
  gazing into the sky)
* Akladians invading Wesnoth -- plundering, wondering what spoons are for, and
  trying to hear the stories imprisoned within books (for prologue)
* An image illustrating how Grekulak escaped through the swamps (for Deorien's
  story: a dark silhouette on dark background)

* An image illustrating the Akladians' escape across the deserts (Deorien's story)
* An image illustrating the siege of Weldyn (Akladians sturming walls)

  gates of Weldyn
