MUSIC
-----
The Music authors details are in music/readme.txt
The composers: Nick Humphrey, Christian Hellerberg and Erik Rijshouwer were
specifically asked to license their work under GPL for wesnoth and they agreed.
Mattias Westlund work is publicly available as GPLd. Other pieces were
taken from the music packages on the wesnoth servers, and therefore have
to be GPLd. Tyler Johnsons donated his composition when asked for fast
tune with electrical guitars, specifically for ANO.

Christian Hellerberg piece was written specifically for A New Order.
Erik Rijshouwer kindly agreed to modify his pieces to make them more suitable
for the use in A New Order.

PORTRAITS
---------
Santiago Iborra: portraits for Karen, Reme, Ruvio, Gawen, Lorin, Huon, Mithrandil
(The last taken from WTactics, they are under GPL)

I _think_ also Milildur and Kyobaine are by Santiago Iborra

akladian_chaotic, akladian_lord, akladian_lord2, bor_cryne, majid, hoyre -- Łukasz Zaręba

farmer_girl, peasant3 -- by Doofus  (peasant3 is a tavernkeeper from his campaign)

Elorain: should be removed, it is the same as in the mainline female+ranger...
old orcish shaman, orcish shaman: are in Son of the black eye.
deorien: same as hylas in The South Guard.
huon: same as swordsman-2 in transparent/core, should be removed

Regven, Kyobaine, peasant1, -- they were taken either from Wesnoth, or
WTactics. Right now I do not remember the details about the author, I will
try to fix this successively.

Majid, Bor Cryne, akladian_lord, akladian_lord2, hoyre, Grekulak - Łukasz Zaręba

The previous version of Grekulak: "Fluffy!!!" <crowbar.assassin@gmail.com>

Medic.png is a frankenportrait (by egallager) of the Mage and Necromancer portraits
from mainline Wesnoth.

ruvio_broken.png was commissioned from a Twitter user who uses the handle
@olivia_lucy46

akladian_wiseman.png, akladian_holyman.png, akladian_wonderman.png,
kyobaine_winter.png, brigand.png, and outlaw_rader.png were commissioned from
Onehourlate

young-saurian.png was commissioned from a Twitter user who uses the handle
@AlysaaArt

other were made by me (A.D.Danilecki). In general, if a portrait is ugly, most
likely I did it :)

SPRITES
-------
Akladians:  new version: Sleepwalker, original: A.D.Danilecki, except few
corrected or made by Peter Geinitz aka Shadow aka Wayfarer (they are in
wayfarer directory, e.g. Lady Lorin and Fastfoot) SlyVenom: Frankenportraits

GIMP BRUSHES USED TO CREATE STORY IMAGES
----------------------------------------
I have used the gimp brushes by: VPDesigns, converted by droz928, LJFHutch,
iceytina, damnicons, sarah-dipity, mairin duffy, lifetb, akisu-sama, hawksmont,
blackwolf -- downloaded from deviant art pages. I carefully choosen only those
brushes, whose authors clearly stated the conditions of use, deemed by me to be
compatible with GPL. Some of them forbid distribution of the brushes itself,
but they allow to create and then freely distribute a work based on those
brushes. E.g. LJF stated: "* Attribution not required except for published
modifications * You may use these for commercial purposes ", Iceytina: 
"You can use these however you like, just please credit me somewhere." Xternal:
"xTernal7 You are allowed to use this brushes for your artwork. Credit is not a
must, but is welcome." Hawksmont: "Brushes created by hawksmont are free to use
in non-commercial and commercial designs." etc.

STORY IMAGES
------------
* Maps: have to check it. They were slightly modified by Spencer Cooley
* Gawen_alone: Gawen is by Santiago Iborra, background 
  (copyright expired) by John MacWhirter (died 1911; art in Public Domain).
  Composed by Spencer "The Sigil" Cooley
* Lorin_alone and Lorin_alone_sharp: by Santiago Iborra, composed into story
  image by Sigil
* Chaos Everywhere: background by me, using silquettes of portraits created by
  Santiago Iborra and from Wesnoth. Foreground: Gawen by Santiago Iborra. 
* Before the battle: using imperial horn blower from WTactics. From the style,
  I think it is by Santiago Iborra. Gawen by Iborra. In addition I have modified 
  portraits from Wesnoth distribution: Elf Landar, Mage, and Footpad (yeah,
  only those three -- the guys in background are just repeated mage pictures).
  Composed by me (A.D.Danilecki)
* Elven Trackers -- by Santiago Iborra with added public domain photo titled 
  snow-covered-hillside-with-small-evergreens.jpg
* Into okladia: the background is a public domain art by Thomas Cole from 1836
  (The oxbow: the connecticut river near northampton). Gawen by Santiago
  Iborra. Akladians by A.D.Danilecki. Put together by A.D.D.
* Leaving Raedwood: from A to Z by A.D.D. Using also brushes I made
  specifically for this image :) Those brushes are also available on
  wesnoth forum.
* People of Vakladia: using FlareMaleHero2 by Justin Nichol, originally for the
  game by Clint Bellanger (http://clintbellanger.net/rpg/), GPLd. I
  (A.D.Danilecki) created dozen of variations
  of this Hero and composed them into this picture.
* Smokes in the forest: basically modified public domain photo titled 
  "forest-dusk-landscape", found with google, with smokes added in gimp
* Walls of Vattin: composed by A.D.Danilecki using Lorin by Santiago Iborra 
  (yeah, that's why her arm is at this awkward position, it's just rotated
  and retouched in gimp) plus the photo from my own collection.
* Swamp Scene: Akladians drawn by A.D.Danilecki, using my own photos. Background
  from public domain photo found on google, called "autumn trees standing in
  water" (duh). 
* story_barnon: from A to Z by A.D.Danilecki. Created using my own photos,
  which I then rendered with my tablet and modified.
* ruins of weldyn, ruvio at freetown, story ruvio, story_leftme, story_cametome,
  fall of freetown, haeltin_defense: Łukasz Zaręba.
  Made especially for ANO :-D Story_leftme was slightly retouched (changing color
  of hair and some little touches to Lorin's face) by me, but those changes are
  almost invisible.
