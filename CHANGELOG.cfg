Changelog for 1.2.12
* Akladian Lord 2 image (By Łukasz Zaręba), removed raban.png
* boris.png replaced by hakim.png from Dunefolk. This is not ideal replacement (far

* akladian/akl-princess changed into wayfarer/akl-princess in attack anims (thx
tr0ll!)
* If players will fail to interrogate enemy leaders and will have no chance to
interrogate new, the "frozen orc" will be found (previously it was only if
player also found out about Reme, so the event was not triggered if player

* removed bar.png and rauke.png, replaced by akladian_lord.png
* added bunch of {IS_LOYAL} to a lot of unit definitions
* modified 04 battle of barnon to make it harder (larger base income for enemies),
changing a map. AI does not cheat in the scenario any more
* making base income larger for scenario 02. It's not to make the scenario harder,
but rather to increase the chances that player will level up his units
* strange bug with Hoyre refusing to escape fixed in Battle of Barnon
* corrected three typos in Polish translation
* HUMAN_DIE and HUMAN_FEMALE_DIE sound lists added
* scenarios checked up to 10th, next scenarios may be not balanced. Hired
Swords was waaaay too easy with reduced fire resistances, so upped it by 10%.

enemies, plus +50 to each side if player has above 400gp
* Bugfix: Oyre posthumously was saying he killed himself in self-defense.

Changelog for 1.2.6

Changelog for 1.2.3

* updated version numbers in bunch of places (seriously, this is to make it easier
for savegame analysis etc)
* removed two unused macros (NOTIMPLEMENTED and NOTFINISHED)
* updated Polish translation

Changelog for 1.2.2c (szopen)

turkish, polish translation, corrected all others since I spotted some errors
in a way fuzzy strings were merged
* gettextized some missing strings..
* some more comments for translators.. but do those comments really work?

Changelog for 1.2.2b (szopen)
* Updated hungarian, german translation

Changelog for 1.2.2a (szopen)
* Changed the version number :) hehehe
* russian and italian translation updated
* added comments for strings to make translations easier

Changelog for 1.2.2 (szopen)

* New dialogue with Kyobaine
* removing redundant images to reduce campaign size
* bunch of typos corrected ("except" instead of "expect", "anyything", "grat you")
* first description of Akladian race in units/_main.cfg
* Making some string uniform, so to make the translators' task a bit easier (e.g.
sometimes one sentence was spoken in two different places, and it seems only
one was corrected, as a result two different translatable strings were created.
Fixed).
* Polish translation updated

Changelog for 1.2.1 (szopen)
* Tweaked music for some scenarios
* Corrected few typos, e.g. "north-eastern" in 07 scenario changed to
"north-western" in objectives (It was reported years ago BTW).
* corrected missing anim when moving Akladian Warrior north
* corrected invalid image placed in 07 scenario.
* Lowering required experience for advance for line of Wiseman-Holyman-Wonderman
* Adding Reme advising player to care more about training his loyal troops, and
not gold (3rd level troops are crucial for playing Battle of Barnon)
* Tweaks in battle of Barnon (setting minimal gold, larger income)
to make it easier for players to win. More turns so player will have greater
chance to get a bonus.
* Making 05 Unexpected guests a little bit easier by adding one more turn.
* Changing name=die into name=last breath in a bunch of scenarios
* 08 Outlaw Base: Breaking the interrogation of Rob Roe once proper question is
asked.
* 08 Outlaw Base: corrected very stupid bug -- The hidden treasury of outlaws could
be discovered by.. outlaws, and then given to Gawen. FIXED
* 10 Siege of Haeltin. Withdrawn one sentence added by Sigil. Removing all
enemy units at the end of scenario (so when Yahyazad and Lorin talk, there
would be no enemies)
* 11 Council in Freetown: corrected stupid placement bug, with Karen standing
in water instead of 9,14
* changed RECALL into RECALLXY in bunch of scenarios
* 14a Scouting near barnon: after interrogating Kariv and finding out about Reme,
the ano_reme_prisoned variable was not set properly. FIXED
* wesnoth engine errors (actually more like a warnings: attack_depth,
passive_leader, protect_leader, recall non existing units)  corrected in
bunch of scenarios
* Hidden treat within 14b Bontom (it's possible now for non-akladian unit to
learn healing there)

Changelog for 1.2.0 (Sigil & A.D.D. "szopen")
* Cleaned up all scenario names to conform with Wesnoth conventions
(number_name) (Sigil)
* Replaced Aragwaithi with Dunefolk (Sigil).
* Andrey Yaranov becomes Majid Yahyazad (Sigil).
* Cleaned up problems with changing back and forth between Lorin and Gawen as
leader since Wesnoth 1.9.6 supports multiple leaders. Ruvio also a leader.
(Sigil)
* fix for having enough gold after battle of barnon - somehow, in some
situations the gold was missing.
* battle of barnon: hoyre escapes when threatened; two other recall more
soldiers (escape suits Hoyre, while it does not suit Bor).
* Completely reviewed and updated English dialogue. (Sigil) Note: some changes
were reverted.
* Slight touches to the story, to make easier connection to the sequel, if it
will ever be created.
* Small changes to the dialogues to make the text flow better, also small
addition with Kyobaine complaining about winter, additional dialogue with
Deorien explaining why Oracle does not simply declare that Akladians should
become happy hippie's etc
* New custom portraits for Gawen, Lorin, Ruvio, Karen, Reme (Sigil), Akladian
Peasant, and generic portrait shared by Akladian Warrior, Light Infantry and
Clansman
* Borrowed "updated" potraits for numerous others (Sigil)
* Bug fix: (Original Report: In "Ally from the Past", Gawen's XP reset to zero
(level 2 Hargarthen). This was a little irritating seeing that I had him a
third of the way to level 3 previous scenario - nothing big though.) (Sigil)
* Gawen could be killed in battle of barnon and nothing happened. Fixed
* New sprite animations for akladian clansman and warrior. Sprites slightly
modified
* new story images:  gawen alone, lorin alone, lorin sharp (Sigil), before the
battle, chaos everywhere, into okladia, leaving raedwood,  people of
vakladia, ruins of weldyn, ruvio at freetown, story barnon, story leftme, story
ruvio
* removed portraits for Roe and mages; they were anyway the same as in the mainline
* slightly modified Akladian stats: since they now face Dunefolk and not
Aragwaithi, I raised their fire resistance. Without it, the Hired Swords is a
piece of cake and Siege of Haeltin is a walkover, while they SHOULD BE HARD.
(Bunch of naffats simply were cutting through akladians like hot knife through
the butter).  Not to mention without this there was no real incentive for
player to recall Akladians.
* some maps were slightly changed
* Synchronise RISE_UP macro with TRoW, since previous version caused that
raised undead units were lost on save
* Elvish units Milildur and Elorain were supposed to become loyal after 5
recalls, but they weren't. FIXED.
* incorporated suggestions from TODO file: removing Dark Spirit, Henchman,
replacing Human Ranger by Ranger, Saurian Tribalist by Saurian Augur,
Icecaster by Oracle.
* added ADVICES.txt, LICENSE.important.txt, ART_authors.txt, modified
README.txt with some background informations and suggestions
* added a lot of music.
* In Siege of Barnon one Dunefolk unit should now become loyal, as it supposed
to be. Previously the message was shown, but no unit actually became loyal,
FIXED.
* Dunefolk units added to add-on, because they were removed from the mainline
in wesnoth 1.9.10
* In scenario 12 (Leaving Raedwood) removed Wiseman from recruit list. AI does not
know how to use them. The same with 19c (Oracle) and 22 (Leaving Okladia)
* In 14c (She-wolf of Haeltin) Lorin had the HP the same as in the last battle,
instead of being fully healed. FIXED
* In 14c (She-wolf of Haeltin) Karen and Ruvio appeared in strange place, and
Lorin was hidden before move_fake started.  FIXED
* Infinite numer of moves in 13 Scouting, 18 Start of the Quest, 20 Okladia
* removing old images: lorin_uneasy.png, reme_gawen.png, story_zima_grup[a].png and  other..,
* WML macros changes: MAKELOYAL, MAKE_LOYAL, NEXT_SCENARIO_CONTINUE
* If in 15a (The preparations) player wanted to go directly to choose 12 best
troops, previously game failed with missing ano_16 scenario message. FIXED
* If in 23 (Trapped) the scenario finished with timeover,
the game failed with missing ano_24 scenario message. FIXED
* changed interrogations from event=die to event=last breath
* Ensured Lorin only once is puzzled why Gawen calls her "mother"
* Rebalanced 19c (Oracle); If player does nothing, AI should capture Oracle
within at most 7 turns; I tried hard to ensure Oracle would not be captured
earlier than in 6th turn; It should force player to act quickly
* in 20 (Oracle) Peasant should not talk about ghosts if they were defeated by
Gawen. FIXED
* Rebalanced 23 (Trapped). Some people were complaining it is too hard, while
others that it is impossible to pass through. For me on NORMAL it is very easy
to survive to the time limit, but hard to defeat all enemies.
* Rebalanced 27 (Orannon). Added a trap if Player attacks Bor Cryne too early.
This is a lame way of preventing scenario from finishing before Grekulak appears,
as some hardcore maniacs were able to finish the game within 10 turns. Huon
stops recruting peasants when Grekulak appears. More zombies for Grekulak and
small changes to the map.
* Added dejavu events in two scenarios (when player "cheats" by reloading after
he loses some of his units)

Changelog for 1.1.100
* NEXT_SCENARIO ano-13 changed to ano_13 in 14b.cfg
* in ano-13, Ruvio won't advise to search for Reme if he is already saved, or if Gawen have failed to save Reme
