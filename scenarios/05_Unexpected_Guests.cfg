    # While some players think this is an extremely easy scenario,
    # a lot of others were complaining this is frustrating and too hard.
    # Therefore, I've decided to add one more turn to make it a little bit easier:
    {TURNS 28 25 23} # added one turn to NORMAL and EASY
    # On normal I was able to get an earlier finish on the 22nd turn.
    # Once I had to kill orc on the very last turn.
