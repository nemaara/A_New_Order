        {MSGW_Yahyazad _"Lorin, you are an able commander, a strong warrior, and have a lovely... tactical mind. If you are a wolf, it would be quite the feat for a man to tame you... but I have to try anyway."}
        {MSGW_Lorin _"Listen underling, I am not an animal to be tamed or a prize to be won. The only thing which stays my hand from snuffing out your life after hearing such a remark is that I still need you. But you are dangerously close to the line, so..."}
        {MSGW_Yahyazad  _"I am no fool, Lorin. I understand that you suffer my presence now only of necessity. But perhaps there will come a time when you no longer suffer my presence of necessity, but welcome it by choice?"}
        {MSGW_Lorin _"You may not see it, but you are a fool. An honorable fool, but a fool nonetheless."}
        {MSGW_Yahyazad  _"What do you mean?"}
        {MSGW_Lorin _"First of all, you forgot to say 'one more reference to underling and I'm leaving'. Look, Yahyazad, I am many things, but I am not blind. I've noticed the way you look at me. At first, I couldn't figure out what it meant; I am not used to those kinds of glances. I can easily recognise fear, hatred, loathing, and disdain. But this... "}

You have no idea how bad. Avoid me. Third, you are not my type. Fourth, there are some Akladian customs of which you are seemingly unaware."}
