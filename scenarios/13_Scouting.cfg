        {MSGW_Gawen _"Majid Yahyazad, Lorin is my step-mother, but she has never really shown any tenderness, even to me. I have always known her to be a harsh and unforgiving woman."}
        {MSGW_Gawen _"I'm afraid pursuing her will come with a heavy price. I think she thinks love is a weakness... she seems more interested in war and finding new ways to cause pain to others."}
        {MSGW_Yahyazad _"Ah, Gaumhaldric, perhaps you are right, but if it will be as a war to unlock her heart, I am prepared to wage it. I am well-acquainted with the ways of war."}
        {MSGW_Yahyazad _"Besides, in the end, the war for the affection of a worthy woman is the only war where the price to win is a privilege, not a burden, to pay."}

        {MSGW_Yahyazad _"I do... and shall gladly pay the price to try to win her heart. "}
        {MSGW_Gawen _"You have my blessing, noble Majid, for what it's worth. Sometimes the ruthlessness of the 'She-Wolf of Haeltin' still scares even me. "}
