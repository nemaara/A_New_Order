            story=_"Carrenemoes have loyally served our kings for generations. I am Reme, son of Raul. My ancestors, according to our family legends, were amongst those who led our people in the great revolt and then in our epic escape through the desert. They established large kingdoms in the lands of underlings, for which we paid a steep price in blood.  Now... why do I wonder what was that price paid for?"

            story=_"Perhaps it is because of Gawen. Before I began serving his father, I never wondered about the differences between us and underlings. It was simple: God himself gave us this world to rule; everyone else was to serve us. Yet, Gawen Hagarthen is half underling. In fact, he looks a lot like one of them. And he was always more brave and honorable than many Akladians I know... "

        [part]
            story=_"Enough of these thoughts. Gawen has been officially crowned king. Lorin wants the Akladian lords to acknowledge that. She almost seems to be smiling for the first time in many, many months. I wonder what Gawen remembers about her. It seems he remembers nothing, which is a lucky coincidence for her. She seems to forget that less than half of our lords appeared in Vattin. The battle over Gawen's succession is not yet won."
