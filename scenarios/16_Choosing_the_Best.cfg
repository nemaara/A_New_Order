The finest dancers from among Freetown's girls and women, doing traditional folk-dances in special costumes with masks and shawls, danced for us."

On my right, Karen kept commenting on the dancers' faults and bragged about how she was much better, and how even her dancer's costume was better. On my left I heard Majid Yahyazad trying to seduce my step-mother, even harder as he became more drunk. Lorin ignored him, babbling about something the Oracle had told her in her youth."
