            #po: Spoken by Gawen. "Scurrying" means running very fast (like a mouse or some other small rodent)
            story=_"When I returned to the castle, it looked like a beehive with so many Akladians scurrying here and there. When I asked where Lady Lorin was, they avoided my eyes and muttered incoherently."

        [part]
            story=_"Finally one of them said that Lady Lorin committed some kind of terrible crime, and she was caught by the guards; she tried to fight them off, but she was still too weak after her strange accident on the battlefield and was easily overwhelmed."

        {MESSAGE (Luc Hagarthen) (portraits/luc.png) (Luc Hagarthen) _"In other words, the witch must die."}
        {MSGm_Reme _"Remember, that she's the king's step-mother."}
        {MSGa_Gawen _"That's ridiculous. I want her to be released immediately, and then ..."}
        {MSG_Graeme _"You want to start your rule with a gross violation of one of our most important customs? We agreed for some rights for Wesnothians, we tolerate the presence of MAGES here and even the ELVES, but changing the very foundations of our way of life?"}
        {MSGa_Gawen _"I am the messiah! I declare that those customs are no longer valid! Release her!"}

        {MSGa_Gawen _"That's... Ruvio, Huon!"}

        {MSGa_Gawen _"Nothing."}
        {MSG_Deorien _"Noble lords, my king. I am a mage, and I know how you feel about me. However, I have a proposal, which I hope will satisfy both the assembled lords and the king."}
        {MSG_Deorien _"Why must we kill her? I am familiar with your customs, and I've heard of women which were left alive after betraying their husbands. Only their eyes - not their lives - were taken."}
        {MESSAGE (Gauri Hagarthen) (portraits/gauri.png) (Gauri Hagarthen) _"It's the same. A man or woman who cannot see is dead, since he belongs to the darkness."}
        {MSG_Deorien _"Exactly. So, take only the eyes of Lorin but leave her alive."}
        {MSG_Graeme _"Leave her alive, so she could remain here, amongst us? No, that's..."}
        {MSG_Deorien _"She could also be exiled."}
        {MSG_Deorien _"...and one more thing: why punish an innocent child for the crime of the father and mother? Let the child live."}
        {MESSAGE (Gauri Hagarthen) (portraits/gauri.png) (Gauri Hagarthen) _"But if we put out Lorin's eyes, she will surely miscarry."}

        {MSG_Deorien _"My king, my proposal is, in the end, a way to protect both her and her child. And it also protects Wesnoth. One woman is not worth civil war. And you know it."}
