            story=_"After Gawen's death, I felt dead as well. Then Reme left me and I was all alone. I couldn't go back to my family. They hated me because I had failed to fulfill their hopes. They hated me because I was always independent. Maybe they hated me because I reminded them how I became the wife of Gawen's father and queen of Vakladia."

I took the soldiers Reme gave me for my protection and I rode east. I knew people there, who could help me. Akladians would not fight for me - I was sure of that - so I had to find someone who would.

            story=_"I found a group of the people we Akladians referred to as the 'Dunefolk'. They had some other name for themselves that, in their barbarian and unworthy language, meant something like 'noble leader', but it mattered not, for we did not use that name for them. They were mercenaries offering their services to anyone. They were not like most of the rest of the underlings; their ancestors came here from distant lands, but they accepted into their ranks anyone willing to take their vows and abide by their traditions. Even some Akladians found a place amongst them."

        [part]
            story=_"Of all the underlings living in Vakladia, these were they who had resisted us most fiercely. In the last great battle, when all the other underlings were running for their lives, the Dunefolk troops withstood us with determination and honor. None left the battlefield alive; they fought and fell to the last man. That's why we cut off their heads, hands and legs, so that in the afterlife they would not be danger to us."

            story=_"I found one of their asa'ir and talked to their leader, a man called Majid Yahyazad. I wanted swords and I had gold; they had swords and wanted gold, so we struck a deal quickly. I felt uneasy amongst them; their speech, dress, and customs screaming 'underling.' But I consoled myself with the thought that they were only hired swords."
