            story=_"The day was bright when Gawen Hagarthen entered the forests of Raedwood. There, inside the very heart of the forest, lay the city of Freetown, founded by refugees from lands under the heavy Akladian yoke. Life was not easy here, food was scarce, and yet smiles were often seen on the faces of men and women."

        [part]
            story=_"Karen said she could smell the freedom in the air here. Gawen smelled nothing out of the ordinary, though... only the scent of meats being roasted over an open flame. 'Perhaps it is not given to royalty to smell freedom,' he thought. Messengers waited for Ruvio, asking him to come to the meeting of the Freetown leaders. "

Something greater, something evil, is hiding behind this. What it is, we do not know. I came here to warn you, to help you, and ask for your help. We need you to find out the real reason the Orcish army is here. We also need to discover who is hiding behind the invasion. We have our suspicions, but we want to be sure."}
