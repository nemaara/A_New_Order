            story=_"I was trying to get to Freetown as quickly as possible. On the way I heard dark news - about Akladian armies in Raedwood forest, columns of smoke in the woods. I was expecting the worst, yet I was still surprised."

        [part]
            story=_" From the first moment I knew that Freetown had not been taken by orcs. Orcs couldn't possibly be that atrocious. Children killed together with their mothers. Impaled girls and men on the trees. People burned in their houses. And still, no matter how stupid it seems, I still held out hope."

            story=_" Her face, though smeared with dirt and blood, was untouched. She lay in a position which clearly told me her fate before she met the blow of mercy. I knelt next to her, fondling her hair as I used to do when she was a child. I felt nothing. I should have felt anger, despair, I should have screamed for vengeance, but I felt nothing. My wife, my daughters, dead? It was too impossible to be believed."

            story=_"Gawen, I think Karen loved you. I don't know what your feelings were towards her, but I always hoped that you two might find happiness together, and despite knowing it would be impossible - despite knowing that you would have to make some dynastic marriage one day - I even foolishly dreamt you could found a new dynasty."

            story=_" I don't know how long I tarried there. I didn't care about anything. Akladians have taken everything from me. First they took your mother from me. Then they killed her. And now, they have killed my daughters, my wife, my whole family."
