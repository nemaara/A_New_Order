He married a Wesnothian princess from Elensefar. He united three Akladian kingdoms, while the fourth one - Guilcorta - became his fief. He made alliances with the Dunefolk Ostans within his borders but allowed them considerable self-governance. He made vassals of most of the former Wesnothian kingdoms, uniting almost the whole of Wesnoth at its most glorious point."

            story=_"Lorin journeyed among the Ostans of the Dunefolk, taking the vows required to join them, all the while searching for Majid Yahyazad. He took care of both her and her child, raising the child as if it were his own son, and showing toward her the love and respect he felt ought to be accorded to the She-Wolf of Haeltin. While rumors cast doubt on their happiness together, there was no doubt of their devotion to each other; they spent the rest of their days together."

Tutored by Gawen and Deorien as well as Ruvio, Caerwyn revived the ancient Wesnothian order of Paladins and performed many mighty deeds in the land of Wesnoth and beyond, becoming a noble and respected figure in Wesnoth in his own right. When Ruvio passed away, seventeen years to the day after rescuing Gawen at the Battle of Barnon, Caerwyn - with Gawen's blessing - laid him to rest in the royal cemetery in Vattin, with the remains of Gawen's mother on one side and those of Ruvio's own beloved wife and daughters on the other."
