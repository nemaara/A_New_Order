Fearing that the citizens would open the gates to Gawen Hagarthen, he withdrew to his castle in the forests nearby. Indeed, the city of Barnon surrendered easily, though the citizens didn't show any signs of enthusiasm."

The former considered him a barbarian beast and a tyrant, and the latter called him mixling - at best. The irony of this realization was so overwhelming that he began to laugh. He probably would have laughed even harder if he had heard some of his warriors; they whispered that Gawen was laughing in anticipation of the battle, and their esteem for him rose dramatically."
