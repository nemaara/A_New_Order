            story=_"After few days of preparation, the first-born sons of the Akladian lords appeared in Vattin. They became guests of King Gawen Hagarthen and his step-mother Lady Lorin. He, accompanied by two lords and a small army, marched north to the settlements of the clan of Barnon."

        [part]
            story=_"Hoyre O Barnon did not trust the Wesnothians living in the city of Barnon. Fearing that the citizens would open the gates to Gawen Hagarthen, he withdrew to his castle in the forests nearby. Indeed, the city of Barnon surrendered easily, though the citizens didn't show any signs of enthusiasm."

        [part]
            story=_"It was at this moment that Gawen realized that he was as hated by Wesnothian folk as by Akladians. The former considered him a barbarian beast and a tyrant, and the latter called him mixling - at best. The irony of this realization was so overwhelming that he began to laugh. He probably would have laughed even harder if he had heard some of his warriors; they whispered that Gawen was laughing in anticipation of the battle, and their esteem for him rose dramatically."
