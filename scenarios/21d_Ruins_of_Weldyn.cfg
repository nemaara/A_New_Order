            story=_"Lorin said that Akladians were at first unable to take Weldyn; without artillery nor bows, they never were good at taking fortified cities. They besieged the city for years, storming the walls with ferocity and fanatical courage."

            story=_"Finally, the walls were breached with the help of treachery from within. The traitor was promised three bags of gold for opening the city gates. The Akladians kept their promise. The tale has it that they tied the three bags of gold to the traitor's legs before they pushed him from the walls into the river."

In the darkest hour of Wesnoth, I gathered the last surviving mages of Weldyn and we hid in the library. Then... well, I will explain everything to you. But first, you must hear a story. A very long story... Gawen, what do you know about the origins of the Akladians?"}

Lorin would tell the legend of how God created Akladians so that they could rule over the world, but that a false messiah imprisoned them, so they rebelled and then they journeyed here. She knows only legends and myths passed down from person to person, losing a little bit of truth each time in the re-telling."}
        # Added by Sigil: "This is why we labored to save as many books and scrolls as we could when the Akladians put our libraries to the torch... it is far less easy to corrupt the written word on a page than to corrupt a story in the re-telling." I think this makes the sentence too long... and it is already too long for a Wesnoth dialogue. And it does not add enough to the story.
        {MSG_Deorien _"And yet, for every myth there is a true event which started it, a true beginning twisted and confused with the passing generations. Listen to me now."}
