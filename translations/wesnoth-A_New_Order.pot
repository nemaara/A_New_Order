Those few old men that manage to survive are outcasts, regarded as cowards and shunned."

#. this is based on the fact that in the Polish version of Shrek, there is a scene in which Lord Farquad learns that Żwirek flirts with Muchomorek.

#. [about]
#. Polish president (from 2010 to 2015), he can't spell. Famous for dozens of idiotic sentences and sayings. You are free to replace him with some politician from your country.
#. A good way to test to see if a particular politician would fit here would be to google their name along with the word "gaffe" and see if people have made articles out of lists of said gaffes.
#. Please only make fun of politicians for their gaffes here, and not their actual policies, as the Wesnoth add-on server has a policy against overly political or ideological content.
