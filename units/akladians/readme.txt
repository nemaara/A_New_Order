1. Don't give Akladians ranged weapons. Ranged weapons are for cowards. Giving
   Akladians ranged weapons will destroy the balance against other factions.
2. Wiseman-Holyman-Wonderman are supposed to be very, VERY rare. It should be
   extremely hard for players to advance Wiseman, hard enough so most players
   will decide to forget about it. This also means that using the
   LIMIT_CONTEMPORANEOUS_RECRUITS macro on them on AI sides both makes sense and
   is a good idea.
3. The numbers now are experimental and are effect of suggestions by AxalaraFlame
4. Gawen's line is Young Hagarthen -> Hagarthen -> Lord Hagarthen, while Lorin's
   line is Akladian Lady -> Akladian Princess -> Akladian Queen
