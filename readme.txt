The old kingdom of Wesnoth has fallen before barbarian hordes. The occupying
barbarians are on the brink of civil war, the seeds of Wesnothian rebellion
are kept alive by old legends, while bandits and Dunefolk mercenaries roam
the land. Can Gawen Hagarthen unite these disparate factions against a common
foe?

Known problems (note: out of date; see GitHub issue tracker instead):
* Sometimes after downloading the campaign, some of the images are not shown
  correctly. Before reporting a bug to me, try quit the wesnoth program
  completely and then start it again. If this won't help, contact me.
  Clearing wesnoth cache also helps.

What this file (readme.txt) contains: the credits and acknowledgments; how you
can thank us; the ideas for new campaigns. Probably the only Wesnoth campaign
with such a huge readme file :)

Wesnoth demands that all content should be released under GPL license. GPL has
specific conditions on "source"; however, it is not clear what is a "source"
for an image or a music piece. Therefore, the file LICENSE.important.txt
contains important note on copyrights. Read it carefully before distributing
the images and music. In short, we allow to distribute the images and music
under GPLd provided that GPL does not require us to provide e.g. sketches for
images, tracker modules, or source waves for the music.  Before screaming we
are incompatible with Wesnoth licensing scheme read the LICENSE.important.txt.
ONCE AGAIN, _DO_ READ IT BEFORE WRITING US OR COMPLAINING. 

The ART_authors.txt lists all the authors of the images and the music I could
remember. You can send me more names if you know them.

This campaign contains mature themes. Do not allow your children play it.
I have children and they do not play this campaign. Neither should yours.
If you are a child under 13, please do not play it. 

Do not read the rest if you have not finished the campaign. It contains the 
spoilers. If you spot a spelling mistake here (or when playing a game), or
if you want to correct the English, please report it at the forum, or open
a pull request on GitHub.

HOW TO THANK US
---------------
If you enjoyed this campaign, say so. I love comments. Sigil probably loves
comments. Previous maintainers (Tapik, Typhoon, viorc) also love comments.
Register at the forum and say you liked it. Discuss your impressions. This
is our reward for our work. Even if you didn't like it, post your
opinion too. Remember, I and others actually *paid* our own money so you could
enjoy this campaign for free.

If you want to do something more, you can consider:
* donate to WTactics; we took some GPL images from there.
* donate to Wesnoth; this is a great game.
* buy tracks from Mattias Westlund; we shamelessly used many of his tracks
* buy tracks from Christian Hellerberg
* Well, Erik Rijshouwer does not sell his music as far as I know, but you can
  send him email saying how much you loved his pieces :) Of course, if you want
  to donate him a new porsche, do not hesitate, he will be happy I think. Same
  goes for Nick Humphrey. 
* If you have artistic skills, consider making us a story image, portrait,
  sprites, or sprite animations. We really need these!
* If you are a musician, consider composing a track for us. 
* If you want ANO to have better images, consider buying an image and sending
  it to us. We paid about 20-40USD per image, but be prepared that many
  artists charge three times more. It takes time to find artists willing to do
  a quality portrait with an affordable price.
* Correct typos, beta-test this, and make us famous by praising us. But I said
  so already, didn't I :D
* Create free art content for a Wesnoth (images or music)
* Create a new user-made campaign
* Create or correct a translation for you own language (read TRANSLATORS.txt)
* Finally, you can also donate us; Think about this: would you buy us a beer? 
  If so, then instead donate this money (3-4 euro or 4-5 USD) either to us, or
  to Wesnoth, or to WTactics, or... whatever. If you donate, we will use this
  money to buy new graphics, not for ourselves. As I have already written,
  we need about 20-40 USD per portrait or story image (depending on how
  complicated an image is). This is not a payment for a campaign; this is to
  fund new portraits. In other words, this is in order to allow the others
  enjoy the campaign even more. And we may then decide to create a sequel :)
  Use moneybookers or paypal. You have to register, though. The transfer with
  moneybookers costs about 1 euro (0.5 fee by moneybookers, but in my country
  my bank also charges for transferring to my account in moneybookers); 
  http://www.howtopayonline.org/moneybookers.html. Paypal charges percentage of
  the amount, I *think* it is about 5%. My account is "szopen@europe.com" -- if
  you made a transfer, you may also consider to send a suggestion for which
  portrait should be done next. TODO: Sigil's credit card or account here as
  an alternative payment form for a donation?

Note that none of this is mandatory and you should under no circumstances feel
obliged to do any of this. Saying you like it is enough to make us happy :) :)
(Ok, I don't know about the others, but I LOVE to read when people write
they like my work :D A.D.D). 

I won't be buying more images for sure; I have commissioned six story images
and five portraits. Sigil bought five portraits. One story images and two
portraits were commissioned by three other players (tr0ll, wussel, alhaz).
I have counted how many images ANO needs to make me feel it is REALLY finished
in terms of graphics, and then how much it would cost me, and the decision is:
no way (it would take my full two month salaries). Current cost of ANO
amounts to just about 350 euros (more or less, since I pay in PLN, and Sigil
paid in dollars but he never told me how much he spent, so I assume here that
he paid just a little bit more for the portraits than I).

SO YOU WANT TO CREATE A SEQUEL?
-------------------------------
Once Typhoon wanted to make a sequel for "A New Order". He has never finished
this and his sequel is _not_ official.

If you want to use ANO as base for your story, I suggest:
* How did the Akladians conquer Wesnoth? How could a band of barbarians conquer
  a vast kingdom? This is great occassion to show how kings will hire Akladians
  to kill other kings, how they cut their own throats, not notifying that
  Akladians are something more than just barbarians you can hire to plunder
  your neighbours' countryside.
* Ruvio's story screams to be written. How did he become a famous rebel leader,
  who is widely known amongst Wesnothian folk, but virtually unknown amongst
  Akladians?
* For a sequel, I have an outline of what should happen later. But I have no
  time to script it. If you want to write a campaign, contact me, we can
  discuss it. Yes, it should feature Gawen's son. It should also have his
  half-brothers. It should have Bor Cryne's son. But it will not be about how
  Gawen's son reclaims his throne. Just as in ANO there are some things hidden,
  which have long bothered me and which probably nobody noticed; I have a list
  of things which bother me now, and I would want to write them in a campaign.
  The campaign should also feature a prominent female Akladian. And a love
  story, too, of course :D, since both boys and girls love love stories.
* Also, I had/have ideas which I wanted to implement within ANO, but never had
  time. This includes hidden scenario which was never created, and which
  supposed to be when leaving Okladia; a doll substory to add more depth for
  Lorin character; The Ruvio character's other daughters; more diversification
  depending whether in Barnon player chose the eastern or western outpost.
  If you want to help implement them, or if you have some your own ideas, go
  ahead and contact us (it means me, since Sigil seems to be extremely busy
  these days).

WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT AKLADIANS?
----------------------------------
There is Timeline.txt in scenarios directory. Also, Akladians originally had
richer back story; however, I lost all my notes on the topic. The initial idea
was to introduce barbarians into the civilised Wesnoth world. I mean
barbarians like Huns -- wild, cruel, barbarians despising civilised people. 
In addition, I hated the idea, which was in 2005 a gospel, that Wesnoth has no
religion.  This was almost mandatory then. I thought it is absurd that there
would be no culture with religion in Wesnoth world. I am atheist, mind you
(Turin said that _exactly_ because I am atheist I cannot imagine a world
without a religion :-) ).

Initially one player said the story is similar to the Dune; I've read the Dune,
but if I was influenced, it was subconscious. Later I have introduced
three references to Dune within the campaign. You should have no trouble with
finding them :) ...but actually only two are left now, once Sigil removed
Aragwaithi. The "sietches" (settlements of Aragwaithi) name was taken from
Dune.

Anyway, here you have some ideas which never went into the story, and various
other remarks.  Some of those are results of discussion with Sigil. You may
find them useful when creating a sequel or whatever.

* Bor Cryne and Lorin were supposed to be engaged as children, before Lorin's
  family went to the Oracle and then got a better deal.
* Bor Cryne has only one child. His other children died. He has no wife; she
  died giving him the last son and he never married again (unusual for
  Akladians).
* Akladians have less children with every passing year and generation. While
  in the past they had 10 children and more, nowadays (i.e. during the
  campaign) they have no more than three, with this number steadily decreasing.
  With high child mortality and their lifestyle, it means they are dying out.
  However, mixed marriages have no troubles with the fertility.
* Ruvio was one of the leaders of the rebellion. The rebellion was crushed in
  part because some of the leaders were traitors: they were bought by the
  promises of gold, safety and power. The promises were not kept, and the
  leaders were killed. Ruvio was one of the few, who refused the promises and
  kept fighting. He is from highest ranks of aristocracy, and probably no one
  else in Freetown has better blood than him.
* In Akladian culture, woman should know how to fight and they often do fight,
  when required. Lorin is not despised because she is a fighter. She is
  despised because she tries to carry her own politics, instead of silently
  following her family. In addition, she is blonde: this is extremely rare
  amongst Akladians, which means her clan is viewed with suspicion by other
  clans.
* Akladians believe in one God, but they do not "worship" their God. They are
  making deals with him. Note how Reme treats sacrifices as part of the deal:
  "you help me escape from the Battle of Barnon, I will give you a horse".
  They are not sophisticated enough to think about God as about something other
  than being similar to their own lords (only somewhat more powerful).
* Akladians believe in afterlife (In the beginning in 2005, I think no faction 
  had any beliefs or religions, so it was quite unusual then, except maybe
  UtBS). They believe afterlife is the same as on the earth: they will fight
  there, drink, plunder etc.  They can also die in afterlife, but they will be
  reborn the next day. People who lose their hands, eyes, or anything, will
  lose them also in afterlife.  It is customary to provide fake hands for great
  lords, in order to deceive the ghosts guarding the gate to the afterlife. 
* Akladians believe in honour, but what they consider to be honourable, may be
  different from we consider honourable. To deceive an enemy is ok. The
  outright lie is not. To kill weaker, plunder, rape etc. for Akladians is
  still OK thing or a honourable man to do. To escape from a battle -- no no
  no. To break a word given to an underling is OK. To break a word given to
  another "worthy" Akladian -- no no no. Basically they divide everything into
  "worthy people" and the cattle. However, at the time of ANO they have lived
  amongst Wesnothian long enough to get influenced by other ideas of honour.
  But they are emphatically _not_ nice people. You wouldn't want them as your
  neigbours. 
* They live in clans. Each clan has a lord. Clans are connected by the blood,
  at least in theory they descend all from the one man. Leaders are not
  chosen, they choose themselves (usually by killing those, who refuse to
  recognise them). You cannot be born a leader. Or, to rephrase: only people
  born to be leaders may be leaders, but the only way to prove you were born
  to be a leader is to be a great warrior. The Hagarthens' are exception,
  since they are _holy_. They are treated with reverance, their blood is
  sacred, they are link to the God. Sons of lords usually become lords, but it
  is not guaranteed. If they are not good warriors, the common thinking is
  that they were not in fact sons of lords, and they are killed. The same goes
  for simple clansman. It's really hard for a clansman to become a lord, but
  it is possible. 
* Note that for them there is no "peace" period and "war" period. They live
  during constant war. There is no peace. There is only war. Again, since they
  live amongst the Wesnothians, it changes, but they still think about
  themselves as warriors (similar to how the English may think themselves to be
  cool, reserved people, despite the fact that most of them probably aren't.
  Or how Poles think that archetypical Pole is a romantic blue-eyed blonde
  knight :-D ).
* Akladians initially had nomadic way of life. They had no settlements lasting 
  more than one season. While at time of ANO they have their villages and
  castles, this is a result of conquest and they fashionably shun the
  Wesnothian customs, even when they mimic them. When Lorin in first scenario
  decides to get help of Wesnothian medic, this is not a casual decision. I'd
  put there a statement: "Medic? But only underlings live there!" to make it
  clear, but it would make scenario too long.
* While Akladians have elder woman, they have no elder man. Simply, all males
  fight until they die during a fight. At some point they are called to a fight
  by some younger clansman, who can gather experience that way. If a younger
  Akladian kills an elder during this fight, this does not require a revenge;
  The elder is honoured and mourned (also by the one who killed him). Anyway,
  it's better to die with sword in hand during fight, than peacefully in bed
  during sleep, so everyone is happy. 
* Actually, Hoyre should be killed for escaping from a battlefield. This is a
  mistake on my part. Let's pretend this is because Akladians live so long
  amongst Wesnothians that they became "soft", and that their lords try
  to become more like Wesnothian nobility. But the truth is I had not realised
  this contradicts my general vision of Akladian leadership :) There are
  several quirks like that in the story; whenever they contradict what I
  intended to do, or what I wrote here, the campaign version wins.

Do you know what Lorin's questions to the Oracle were? If so, you know
more than me, because I only remember the first and the last question, 
and I am not sure about the second one.

Do you know who betrayed Freetown's location? If so, you know more than me.
I don't know. I never planned to know, in fact. Early on I had a version of
storyline in which the player had a chance to discover it, but I decided this
version was bad and I abandoned it. If you want to be a maintainer, or if you
want to create a sequel, then never, ever give a player chance to discover for
sure who did that. You are allowed to give your own ideas, but make it clear
this is someone's opinion, or one of many possibilities.

However, to make one thing clear: in scenario 19, when Lorin leaves Gawen, she
does not go to the Akladians, or to Freetown.  Guess where she went to and
what for :). You can sent your guesses to the forum :).

Currently, ANO for BfW 1.14 is maintained by Yumi (a.k.a. nemaara). This set of
contributions to ANO are maintained by egallager (a.k.a. cooljeanius). Note that
some of egallager's edits took place in separate repos:
First, his general wesnoth_mods repo, the link for which is here:
https://github.com/cooljeanius/wesnoth_mods/tree/master/campaigns/A_New_Order
And next, a separate ANO repo with its own history:
https://github.com/cooljeanius/A_New_Order
Finally, these contributions were copied over to a fork of Yumi/nemaara's ANO
repo, and submitted back upstream in the form of a pull request. Before BfW 1.14,
mainline ANO was maintained by the original author, that is me: A.D. "szopen"
Danilecki. Beginning with Wesnoth 1.9 (ANO v. 1.2.x), ANO was maintained by
Spencer Cooley 'TheSigil'. Before, ANO was maintained by Oto 'tapik' Buchta
From 1.4 to the ?? (v0.9.9 to current), ANO was maintained by Typhoon
Rhishisikk (Micheal P. Kochis). Before that, ANO was maintained for some time
by Vincent Croisier (viorc), but I can't remember when and how long. If you
are reading this, Vincent, sorry this info somehow went missing from previous
releases. No idea how this could happen.

            That's all folks,
